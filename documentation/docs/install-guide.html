<h1>Openfire Connection Manager Module Installation Guide</h1>

<p>Connection managers distribute the load of client connections to improve
the scalability of XMPP servers. This document will guide you through installing
the connection manager module as a standalone application. For a full list of
features and more information, please visit the
Openfire website: <a href="http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire"
 target="_top">http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire</a></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ul>
<h3>Windows</h3>

 Uncompress connection_manager.zip to <tt>c:\Program Files\connection_manager</tt>.
 
 <h3>Linux/Unix</h3>
 
 If using the .tar.gz, extract the archive to <tt>/opt</tt> or <tt>/usr/bin</tt>:

 <p><tt>tar -xzvf connection_manager_3_0_0.tar.gz<br>
 mv connection_manager /opt</tt></p>

 <p><b>Note:</b> the .tar.gz and .zip builds do not contain a bundled Java runtime (JRE). Therefore, you must have 
 JDK or JRE 1.5.0 (Java 5) or later installed on your system. You can check your java version by typing "java -version" 
 at the command line and (if necessary) upgrade your Java installation by visiting http://java.sun.com.</p>

  </ul>
<h2>Setup Overview</h2>
<p>To complete the installation of the connection manager, you'll need to
perform each of the following steps: </p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#config">Setup</a> - Configure properties to connect to XMPP server.</li>
  <li><a href="#dns">DNS Setup</a> - Configure DNS to properly route traffic.</li>
</ol>

<p>This document also includes information on:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#windows">Running under Windows</a>
    <li><a href="#unix">Running under Unix/Linux</a>
</ul>

<h2><a name="distribution">Files in the Distribution</a></h2>
<p> The files in your distribution should be as follows (some
sub-directories omitted for brevity): </p>
<pre>connection_manager/
 |- readme.html
 |- license.html
 |- conf/
 |- bin/
 |- lib/
 |- resources/
     |-security/
 |- documentation/</pre>

<ul> 
	 <li>The <tt>conf</tt> directory is where the connection manager module stores
configuration files.</li>
  <li>The <tt>bin</tt> directory contains the server executables. Depending
on which distribution you installed, different executables will be available.</li>
  <li>The <tt>lib</tt> directory contains libraries necessary for
running the connection manager.</li>
  <li>The <tt>resources/security</tt> directory is where the connection manager
maintains keystores to support SSL connection security.</li>
  <li>The <tt>documentation</tt> directory contains server
documentation.</li>
</ul><p>

</p>
<h2><a name="config"></a>Properties Setup</h2>
<p>Properties are stored in conf/manager.xml. Only two properties are required to be
configured. The <b>xmpp.domain</b> property that specifies the name of the target server
that clients want to connect to and <b>xmpp.password</b> that specifies the password to
use to log into the server.
</p>

<h2><a name="dns">DNS Setup</a></h2>
<p>XMPP requires that when clients or servers want to connect to another server, a DNS
SRV lookup must be performed to get the real IP address and port to use to connect.
Currently, connection managers only handle client-to-server traffic while server-to-server
will go directly to the server. You will need to configure the DNS server so that client traffic
is routed to connection managers. Depending on your architecture you may want to use a load
balancer in front of a set of connection managers or just configure local DNS servers to
redirect clients to a specific connection manager.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="windows">Running the Connection Manager Module in Windows</a></h2>

<p>Use the cmanager.bat batch file to start the connection manager. The file is located
in the <tt>bin/</tt> directory of your Connection Manager installation.

<h3>Custom Parameters</h3>

<p>Advanced users may wish to pass in parameters to the Java virtual machine (VM) to customize
    the runtime environment of the connection manager module. You can do this by editing the bin/cmanager.bat
    or bin/cmanager.sh files and configuring the JVM_SETTINGS variable accordingly. For example, to set
    the minimum heap size to 512 MB and max VM heap size to 1024 MB, you'd use:

<pre>-Xms512m -Xmx1024m</pre>
</p>

<h2><a name="unix">Running the Connection Manager Module in Linux/Unix</a></h2>

You can start the connection manager module using the <tt>bin/cmanager</tt> script in your
installation:
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><td bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2">
You must make the ant script executable. From the build directory, type:
<p></font><code>
chmod u+x cmanager.sh
</code>
</td></table>
</p>
<p>
# ./cmanager<br>
